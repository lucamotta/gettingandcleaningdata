* Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The included file, run_analysis.R, will perform all the task needed for the course project. The file should be loaded insided the R environment (or RStudio)
and should be run from the root of the directory where the dataset has been unzipped.

The script will create several variables with the desired output. The name and meaning of each variable is described in the codebook (CodeBook.md)
